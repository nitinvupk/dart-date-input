### README

This is a test application built using angular5 and dart2.1. In this application I have implemented a date input with floating calendar popup which can be used in any other component as directive.

To run this application Dart must be installed in your system.

I Created date input `dart` and `html` inside `lib/src` which can be used as directive in any other component.

For demonstration I created a test component in lib folder `test_component.dart` and `test_component.html` which use date input directive.

#### How to configure and run application

* `git clone https://github.com/nitinvupk/dart-date-input.git`

* `cd dart-date-input`

* `pub get`

* `webdev serve`

* Now app will run on `http://localhost:8080/`
